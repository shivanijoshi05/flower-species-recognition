Flower species recognition using Machine learning

Machine learning project to recognize flower species by the characteristics of the iris dataset to train models.Dataset contains 50 rows for each of the three species of the iris dataset (setosa,versicolor,virginica).Each rows has 4 attributes : sepal length,sepal width,petal length and petal width which describe each flower.Trained models learn the patterns using KNN algorithm and then predict the species of flower.
